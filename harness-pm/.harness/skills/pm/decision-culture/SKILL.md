description: Use when you need to drive a team's data-driven decision culture. Data culture automation, driving the implementation of data-driven decision culture through an automated reporting system of daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly reports. Ensures the team always makes decisions based on data. Keywords: data culture, data-driven, decision culture, data literacy, reporting system, get teams to make decisions with data, build data habits, regular data report delivery.

# Data Culture Automation

## Inputs
- rules/security.md
- loops/LOOP.md
- docs/metrics/decision-report.md

## Outputs
- docs/metrics/decision-report.md
- memory/progress.md
- memory/knowledge-base.md

## Core Principles

1. **No disturbance without anomalies**: The value of reports lies in signal-to-noise ratio, not quantity; noisy reports kill data culture
2. **Rhythm becomes habit**: Daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly automated rhythm transforms data-driven from "requirement" to "habit"
3. **Action-oriented**: Every report must have clear next steps; reports without action recommendations are data dumps
4. **Metrics-driven decision standards**: All decisions must follow a standardized decision process, ensuring decisions are traceable and reviewable

## Metrics-driven Decision Standards

### Decision Types and Required Data

| Decision Type | Required Data | Data Source |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Feature priority adjustment | Feature usage rate, retention impact, ROI estimate | Data analysis platform, experiment results |
| Resource allocation decision | Module ROI, business objective progress, bottleneck analysis | Financial data, product data, engineering data |
| Release timing decision | Experiment results, current metric status, risk assessment | Experiment platform, monitoring system |
| Experiment stop decision | Statistical significance, p-value, confidence interval, business impact | Experiment analysis platform |

### Decision Process

```
1. Clarify the decision objective
2. Collect required data
3. Analyze data and draw conclusions
4. Evaluate alternative options
5. Make a decision and record it
6. Follow up on decision results and review
```

### Decision Record Template

```yaml
decision_record:
  decision_id: "DEC-2024-001"
  decision_date: "2024-01-15"
  decision_maker: "Product Manager"
  decision_context: "Whether to fully release the simplified registration flow"
  data_sources: ["Experiment results", "Feature data", "User feedback"]
  key_insights: ["Experimental group conversion rate improved 8.2%", "Positive user feedback", "No significant negative impact"]
  decision: "Full release"
  rationale: "Experiment results statistically significant, positive user feedback, controllable risk"
  expected_outcome: "Overall conversion rate improvement 7-9%"
  follow_up_date: "2024-01-22"
```

## Output Validation Rules

| Field Path | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|------|------|
| report_type | string | Yes | Report type, enum values: daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly |
| report_date | string | Yes | Report date |
| key_metrics | array | Yes | Key metrics list, at least 1 item |
| key_metrics[].name | string | Yes | Metric name |
| key_metrics[].value | number | Yes | Current value |

## Upstream Change Response

When upstream inputs change, this Skill's response strategy:

| Upstream Change | Impact Scope | Response Strategy |
|----------|----------|----------|
| OKR data change | OKR tracking section | Update OKR progress, re-evaluate deviation analysis |
| Decision record change | Data culture metrics | Update data-driven decision rate, re-evaluate culture health |
| Team feedback change | Report template and delivery strategy | Adjust report format and delivery timing |

When culture reports themselves change, the notification mechanism for downstream:

| Report Change Type | Notification Scope | Notification Method |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| OKR progress behind >20% | decision-dace | Mark progress risk, trigger DACE Conclude |
| Data-driven decision rate decline | All downstream | Mark culture risk, trigger training recommendations |
| Report engagement decline | decision-culture | Mark engagement issue, trigger report optimization |

---

## Decision Rules

| Situation | Handling |
|------|----------|
| Core metric anomaly (↓>5%) | Immediate alert delivery, trigger focused analysis |
| OKR progress behind >20% | Annotate risk in weekly report, recommend strategy adjustment |
| Data-driven decision rate <70% | Deliver data culture training recommendations |
| Report open rate consistently declining | Optimize report format and delivery timing |

## Quality Check

- [ ] Daily summary produces no noisy alerts when no anomalies exist (P0)
- [ ] Weekly report includes OKR progress and experiment summary (P1)
- [ ] Monthly report includes complete metric trends and deviation analysis (P1)
- [ ] All data references in reports are traceable to data sources (P0)
- [ ] Quarterly review includes metrics system health assessment (P2)
- [ ] Strategic review includes culture maturity score (P2)

## Degradation Strategy

### Upstream File Missing Degradation Plan

| Missing Scope | Degradation Plan | Output Impact |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Analysis module outputs missing | User provides key metrics → Generate summary report | Report content based on user-provided metrics, lacks automated analysis depth |
| Anomaly detection output missing | Daily summary uses user-provided metric data | Daily report may miss unattended anomalies |
| Experiment results output missing | Experiment summary section in weekly report annotated "to be supplemented" | Experiment progress tracking missing |
| All analysis module outputs missing | User provides key metrics → Generate summary report | Output basic summary report, analysis dimensions annotated "to be supplemented" |

### Data Acquisition Instructions

When upstream files are missing, the user needs to provide the following information to support degraded generation:
- **Key metrics**: Core metric names and current values to track
- **Metric targets** (optional): Target values and baselines for each metric
- **Team focus areas** (optional): Current business issues the team is most concerned about

## Culture Promotion Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----|------|
| No disturbance without anomalies | Reduce noise, only disturb when needed |
| Data consistency | All reports use the same data source |
| Action-oriented | Every report must have clear next steps |
| Continuous iteration | Optimize report format based on feedback |
| Transparency | Everyone can see the data |
