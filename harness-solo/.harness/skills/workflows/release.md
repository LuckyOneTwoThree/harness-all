# Workflow release

> Applicable scenario: Version release, CHANGELOG update, tagging, building release artifacts
> Core mode: verify full validation → writing-documentation update CHANGELOG → tag → build release artifacts

## Differences from Other Workflows

| Dimension | new-feature | **release** |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Goal | Implement new features | Release a version |
| Prerequisite | brainstorming | **All planned features complete (FEATURES.md all done)** |
| LOOP | tdd→verify | **No LOOP (validation-focused)** |
| Output | Code + tests | **Version number + tag + CHANGELOG + release artifacts** |

## Key Checkpoints

- [ ] Are all features in FEATURES.md marked done?
- [ ] Have PROJECT.md's success metrics been met? (Check item by item, show data)
- [ ] Have PROJECT.md's milestone statuses been updated? (Updated in FEATURES.md)
- [ ] Does the full test suite pass? (Show output)
- [ ] Does verify's comprehensive check pass?
- [ ] Security scan has no critical/high?
- [ ] CHANGELOG updated? (Added/Fixed/Changed)
- [ ] Does the version number follow semantic versioning?
- [ ] Were release artifacts verified in a clean environment?
- [ ] Was the tag created? (Don't auto-push)

## Failure Handling

| Failure Point | Handling |
|--------|---------|
| Some features not done | Don't release; finish them or remove from this version |
| Tests fail | Fix and re-validate; no skipping |
| Security scan has critical | Fix before release; don't ignore |
| Release artifact build fails | Fix the build issue; don't publish broken artifacts |
| code-review not passed | Fix issues and re-review |

## Safety Principles

1. **Don't auto-push tags**: Tags are created locally; push requires explicit user confirmation
2. **Don't auto-publish**: npm publish / docker push etc. require explicit user confirmation
3. **Release artifact verification**: Must verify it runs in a clean environment; don't "publish just because the build succeeded"
4. **CHANGELOG accuracy**: Extract from iterations.log; don't write from memory
